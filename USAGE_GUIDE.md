```
"Create a basic text-to-image workflow"
```

The assistant will:
1. Analyze your request
2. Select the optimal model (likely GPT-4-Turbo for code generation)
3. Generate a complete ComfyUI workflow JSON
4. Explain each component
5. Display it in the visual graph viewer

### Understanding Responses

Each response includes:
- **Model Used**: Which AI model processed your request

## Model Router

### Understanding Model Selection

The router considers:
1. **Task Complexity**: How difficult is the request?
2. **Context Size**: How much information is involved?
3. **Task Type**: Is it reasoning, code, or quick inference?
4. **Cost**: What's the most cost-effective option?
5. **Speed**: How fast does it need to be?

### Model Indicators

- üß© **GPT-5**: Used for complex reasoning, optimization, advanced debugging
- üß† **GPT-4-Turbo**: Used for workflow generation, structured outputs
- ‚ö° **GPT-4o-Mini**: Used for quick explanations, simple queries

### Influencing Model Selection

#### Request Complexity
```
"Create a simple workflow"  ‚Üí GPT-4o-Mini or GPT-4o
"Design a complex multi-stage workflow" ‚Üí GPT-4-Turbo or GPT-5
```

#### Explicit Preferences
```
"Quickly explain..." ‚Üí Favors faster models
"Thoroughly analyze..." ‚Üí Favors more capable models
```

A: Very accurate - based on actual token usage and current OpenAI pricing.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: The app requires internet for OpenAI API, but generated workflows can be used offline in ComfyUI.

**Q: How do I export workflows?**
A: Click "Copy JSON" or "Download Workflow" in the workflow viewer panel.

**Q: Can I upload my existing workflows?**
A: Paste workflow JSON in the chat and ask for analysis or modifications.
